The objective of this ReadMe is to set out the layout of the repository and it's contents.
The repository is built up of weekly homework assignments given as part of the Programming and Scripting Module. Each assignment has it's own file which includes the code for the weekly assignment.
I have included a lot explanation of how the code funtions within the .py files and therefore I will not repeat this here. Please refer to the indiviual python scripts within the files and the comments/doucmentation therein for details on how the codes operates as well as areas I found tricky. I have also included where approppriate references to researched code and solutions.

The contents of this repository are as follows:

1. BMI
The task was to calculate the BMI of a person by taking inputs of a person's height in cms and weight in kgs. The program then calculates the BMI of a person.
I added functionlity in the program of printng out whether the person was underweight, ideal weight or overweight.
